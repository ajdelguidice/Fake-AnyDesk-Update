# Fake-AnyDesk-Update
This is to be used on scammers at your own risk. I will not be responsible for any damage that you may have cause to your computer by misusing this.

To use this, you must know the admin password on the scammer's pc and the scammer must already have AnyDesk installed. 

I wanted to use WannaCry for this but I read some articles about it and it seems that WannaCry doesn't work anymore. I may be wrong about that but it's fine.

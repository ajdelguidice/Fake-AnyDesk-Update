# Fake-AnyDesk-Update
READ THE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE USE AND FOLLOW THEM

This is to be used on scammers at your own risk. I will not be responsible for any damage that you may have cause to your computer by misusing this.

To use this, the scammer must already have AnyDesk installed. 

I wanted to use WannaCry for this but I am too chicken to set it up.

I would also like to make an .exe file but I don't know how to make executable files. If anyone has any information on how to do that, it would be much appreciated.
